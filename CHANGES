1.4.2 (2016-05-02):
* Generate a unique ID for each Netfront request. Before, we used
  the grant ref, but multiple requests may use the same ref. This could
  lead to pages being returned to the free pool before they had been
  read by netback.
* Generate a unique ID for each page shared with Xen for received data

1.4.1 (2015-03-14):
* Wait for the backend network device to enter the `Connected` state
  before transmitting packets.  This fixes a race condition in a
  fast-booting unikernel that caused the first packet to be lost (#20, #23).

1.4.0 (2015-03-07):
* Add explicit `connect` function to interface (#19).

1.3.0 (2015-01-24):
* When waiting for space in the transmit queue, we would sometimes fail
  to notice when space became available. (#15)
* Copy out-bound data into pre-shared pages for performance, security
  and simplicity. (#17)
* Use a centrally sourced Travis file and test OCaml 4.02+ as well.

1.2.0 (2014-12-17):
* Add profiling tracepoints and labels (#13).
  Introduces a dependency on `mirage-profile`.
* New `opam` file present in source repository for OPAM 1.2 workflow.

1.1.3 (2014-08-08):
* Revert the serialization in 1.1.2 as Xen/ARM (4.5 and backport to 4.4)
  has been fixed to support granting the same page multiple times.
  Backport is in https://github.com/mirage/xen-arm-builder.

1.1.2 (2014-07-23):
* Wait for packets to be processed by the backend before returning from
  a `writev` call. Without this, the caller has no way to know when
  it's safe to reuse the buffer (#11).

1.1.1 (2014-05-27):
* Do not send oversized frames to the backend Netfront (#9 from Edwin Torok).

1.1.0 (2014-02-01):
* Depend on the unified io-page library instead of io-page-xen.
* Depend on new `xen-event` and `xen-grant` packages.

0.9.0 (2013-12-10):
* Add Travis CI scripts.
* Adapt to V1.NETWORK from mirage-types-0.5.0.
* Initial release based on mirage-platform-0.9.8 Netif.
